Topic:bon App√©tit(An interative website for food recipes)

Hello everyone myself Khushi Karelia and I have come up with this amazing idea of an interative website where users and famous chefs can interact and share variety of delicious food recipes.Our website is a curated collection of culinary delights, offering a comprehensive range of dishes from around the world. Whether you're seeking quick and convenient meals or elaborate gourmet creations, our recipes are designed to inspire and elevate your culinary experience.

Services used:

Basically,in this project I have used 2 Core Services and 1 AI service in Microsoft Azure.

CORE SERVICES:

 1) First Core service is the "AZURE BLOB STORAGE" for the purpose of storing my multiple files and folders, I have used in this website.In Azure Blob Storage,I have created a container which i have used for storing my files that include images, text files, notes.
 2) Second core service i have used is "STATIC WEB APP" to host my website, as it automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to azure from a code repository. It is used for static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images.

AI SERVICE:

The third service i have used is the "AZURE AI LANGUAGE SERVICE". I used it for creating a CHATBOT.So I created a chatbot and connected it in my website to address queries of users regarding the website and its service.I used this service to help build intelligent applications using the web-based Language Studio.

Languages used:
(i) HTML

(ii) CSS
